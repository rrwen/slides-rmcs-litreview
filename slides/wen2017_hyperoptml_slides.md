## Machine Learning

* Learn from data
* Accuracies > 98% possible
* Real-word applications

## Machine Learning Process



---

## Hyperparameters

* Adjustable values
* Affect learning performance
* Before learning process

---

## Hyperparameter Optimization

* Adjustable values $x \dots x_n$
* Affect performance measure $f$
* Find optimal $x \dots x_n$

$$
\underset{x \dots x_n}{\operatorname{argmax}} f(x \dots x_n)
$$
